# Prototype Design Pattern

The prototype design pattern is one of the Creational Design Pattern as described in the original GOF [book](https://github.com/amanver16/ebooks_cheatsheets/blob/master/PDF/Design%20Patterns%20-%20Elements%20of%20Reusable%20Object%20Oriented%20Software%20-%20GOF.pdf)

> Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. 

Below image describes structure of Prototype Pattern

**Prototype :**  
Defines an interface and method for cloning itself.

**Concrete Prototype :**  
Implements the prototype interface and opertaion to clone itself.  

**Client :**  
Creates object by asking the prototype to clone itself.

## About Project
The project describes how Prototype Design Pattern works in practical by using Software Company Employees Application. Remember it is not recommended to fully implement a design pattern as it is, the implementation of a design pattern fully depends upon the use cases of the project. A design pattern if applied at wrong place can mess with the whole application.  

## How to Run
Just compile and run the application using the main class **EmployeeManagement.java**
